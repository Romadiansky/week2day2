# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs into a random six-character string and store a repository of their own shortened treasures.

## Final Product

Below is a step-by-step of all you need to know to make use of this application:

step 1 -- register / login:

  Enter any valid email and password, and you'll have your very own trolly (or repository) created into which you can add, edit and delete urls -- all after running them through our propriotary shrinking technology.

step 2 -- shrink those links:

  Type in and submit any full URL that you'd like to shrink. We will shrink any URL, but only valid ones will actually redirect to your intended site.

step 3 -- manage your trolly:

  You can access your URL's - long and short - from your treasure trolly. In a world that is sometimes busting at the seams, take comfort in your collection of links you've made small. Add to your collection, delete items, or edit them as you please.
